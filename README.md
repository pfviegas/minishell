# Minishell
## As beautiful as a shell

Minishell is a simplified shell implementation in C. This project aims to deepen your understanding of processes, file descriptors, signals, environment variables, parsing, and the fundamentals of Unix shell behavior. By following the Bash reference, you will build a command-line interpreter capable of executing user commands, handling pipes, redirections, and implementing a subset of built-in commands.
